# Video-Processing-Subtracting-Background-with-SVD

# Project Overview:

This project focuses on utilizing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to subtract background from videos. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of SVD, particularly Truncated SVD, and demonstrate its application in video processing. The outcome of this project is to be equipped to efficiently remove unwanted elements from video frames and reduce dataset complexity for data analysis tasks.

# Project Highlights:

- Understand SVD in terms of matrix decomposition.
- Explore Truncated SVD and its significance.
- Implement Truncated SVD using NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Apply SVD techniques to remove background elements from actual video data.
- Optional: Recognize the relationship between SVD and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Bonus: Learn how to use SVD for dimensionality reduction in scikit-learn.
